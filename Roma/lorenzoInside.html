	<p>Arcangelo Corelli was the most famous violinist of his generation, and very popular in Rome. Cardinal Ottoboni paid Corelli to perform his ligth and elegant instrumental music  in some of Europe's first public concerts, called academies, every Monday night. Corelli would also perform in this church, which had a larger apse at the time, so it could easily fit an orchestra for oratorios and concertos.</p>
