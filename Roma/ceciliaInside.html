	<p>After pope Gregor's reform in 590 to 600, masses in all catholic churches were sung in the same manner for 1300 years. Before Gregor, there were local variants, and Roman chant was what was sung here. It is a singer-friendly style with smooth, embellished melodies. Compare it to the splendid medieval mosaics behind the altar.</p>
