	<p>The Baroque period of western music is often said to begin in 1600, and Emilio de' Cavalieri was one of its first composers. His oratorio The Representation of the Spirits in Human Form was first performed in this room in 1599. Both the music and this church is a friendly, light-hearted mix of Rennaissance and Baroque.</p>
