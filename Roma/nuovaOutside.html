	<p>The Chiesa Nuova was built from 1576 to 1599 by the frugal priest Filippo Neri, one of the main figures in the Counter-reformation. The church was embellished after Neri's death, but his simple style can still be felt. His congregation frequently preformed oratorios by <strong>Cavalieri</strong> and other composers.</p>
