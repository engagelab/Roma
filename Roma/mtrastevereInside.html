	<p>When Pope Gregor reformed the liturgy of the Catholic Church from 590, he gave music and song an important place. In the following century, the plainsong developed, a system for constructing melodies to biblical texts and prayers. These melodies do not lead towards a central tone, and have been likened to the lack of central perspective in medieval art, as in the mosaics in this church.</p>
