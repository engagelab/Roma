	<p>Handel worked as <em>kapellmeister</em> for Marquis Ruspoli from 1707 to 1709, composing several oratorios and concertos. Handel was already a celebrated opera composer in the Napolitan style, but as the Pope had banned opera in Rome, Handel used this operatic style in oratorios. This church was completed by Bernini and Moderno 32 years before Dixit Dominus was premiered here in 1707.</p>
